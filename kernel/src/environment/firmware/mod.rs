//! # Firmware Interface Modules
//!
//! This module contains the firmware interface modules that provide access to the firmware-provided
//! services and data structures. These modules are used to interact with the firmware to obtain
//! information about the hardware and the environment in which the kernel is running and perform power management.
//! The firmware interface modules are optional and can be enabled or disabled using feature flags to suit the
//! requirements of the target platform.
//!
//! *PC like systems arr expected to provide UEFI, ACPI, and SMBIOS firmware interfaces.
//! *Embedded systems are expected to adhere to the Embedded Base Boot Requirements (EBBR) specification and provide
//! a reduced subset of UEFI boot services and either ACPI tables or a Flattened Device Tree (FDT).
//! *All ARM64 systems are expected to provide an ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF) and consequently a Secure Monitor Call
//! (SMC) interface. *All RISC-V systems are expected to provide firmware running in M-mode that implements the
//! Supervisor Binary Interface (SBI). *x86_64 systems do all tend to provide firmware operating in System Management
//! Mode (SMM) however the interface to SMM interrupt calls is not standardized and thus must be accessed through the
//! use of ACPI AML code. As such we do not provide a separate module for SMM calls.
