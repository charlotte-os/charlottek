//! #Self Testing Subsystem
//!
//! This subsystem contains diagnostic tests meant to test the kernel itself and aid in development and troubleshooting.
//! Almost all subsystems with the exception of drivers should have at least some tests in this module. In software
//! engineering terminology the tests in this module should be whitebox integration tests that can be run after Purrnel
//! initializes itself.
